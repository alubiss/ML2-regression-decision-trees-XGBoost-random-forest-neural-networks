# ML2 regression decision trees, XGBoost, random forest, neural networks

Project made as part of ['Machine Learning 2: predictive models, deep learning, neural network'](https://usosweb.wne.uw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&prz_kod=2400-DS2ML2) subjects at the University of Warsaw.

The aims of the project were to familiarize with:
- tree-building methods, 
- division algorithms,
- division criteria, 
- interpretation of results, 
- model overfitting problem, 
- stop criteria, 
- tree pruning methods, 
- cross-validation process,
- ensemble learning,
- artificial neurons, 
- topology of neural networks,
- activation functions.
